# The Cave
- The Cave is a short text-based adventure game based on a custom DnD campaign.

- The project is coded in Visual Studio Community in C#. It is a Console App project.

- To avoid spoilers if you want to play the game, don't look at the code. Download the game directly under releases.

- Windows Smartscreen might be suspicious of the .exe file. It is completely safe to continue, it's a short game with around 350-400 lines of code. It's not a virus, I'm not that smart of a programmer ';-). Anyway, to bypass smartscreen, click "More info" and then "run anyway".

- Have you gotten stuck in the game? Remmeber to write simple commands and be specific. For example, don't just write "pick up", "get" or "walk" write what you want to pick up/get and in what direction you would like to walk. 

- Commands don't have to be super specific though, some actions have up to 11 different commands possibilities. So that is 11 different inputs that gives the same output.

- Also lowercase/uppercase does not matter, "GeT KeY" and "get key" will be treated as the same command.

- Spaces matter though, so while "get key" will work " get key" will not work.
